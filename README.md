# Red-and-black-square
Write a program in which there are two squares in red and black (similar to the image below) on the page. When the circle next to the mouse enters one of the squares, the following changes will be made:
A- When the circle is placed inside the black square, the color of the circle should change from blue to red.
B- When the circle is inside the red square, the color of the circle will change from blue to black.
C- The coordinates of the circle, when placed inside each square, should be displayed relative to that square.
Note: The coordinates of the circle, when it is inside each square, should be displayed in only one line, and if the circle is outside these squares, this line (the third line in the figure below) will disappear. Likewise, when this line appears or disappears, none of the other components of the page should be moved.
